# Fierce Stories

Choosing a bedtime story can be a nightmare if you care about diversity. Fierce Stories allows parents and caregivers to customize bedtime stories to include diverse set of characters and subjects. The website is available in two modes (dark/light) to improve its accessibility. Developed as a Rails group assignment by Yoonmi Kim and Sylwia Vargas.
